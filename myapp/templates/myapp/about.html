    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
        Gamification is a novel and popular technique, as well as a rapidly growing
        multi-billion dollar industry.
        With all the news and products surrounding it, telling fact from fiction
        can be difficult.
        At times, even researchers may buy into the hype and conduct biased or
        uncontrolled studies, leading to inconclusive and inaccurate results.
        As a result, instructors are often fed misconceptions by the media or
        marketing, which leads to poor student outcomes in the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website aims to equip educators with a deeper understanding of the
        individual elements behind gamification using experimental results backed
        by published scientific studies.
