    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
        Gamification is a novel and popular technique, as well as a multi-billion dollar industry.
        With all the news and products surrounding it, telling fact from fiction can be difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website aims to equip educators with a deeper understanding of the elements behind
        gamification so that they can better design courses and lesson plans in the future.
        Anyone is welcome, from university professors and grade-school teachers,
        to private tutors and even curious students.
