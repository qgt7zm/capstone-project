<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>
    Gamification is a popular technique, and it can be difficult to tell fact from fiction.
    This website aims to provide all educators a deeper understanding of the elements behind gamification
    so that they can better design lesson plans in the future.
    Anyone is welcome, from university professors and grade-school teachers
    to private tutors and even curious students.
