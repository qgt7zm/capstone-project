    <h2>What is Gamification?</h2>
    <p>
        Gamification is the application of game elements in non-game contexts.

        Students today suffer from a lack of motivation and knowledge retention
        because schools prioritize memorization and standardization over individuality
        and critical thinking.
        Additionally, the recent rise of online learning and digital learning software
        presents additional challenges to both instructors and students.
        Gamification can help bring the excitement back to learning by giving students
        to express their creativity and problem without fear of failure.

        carefully crafted to fit student needs.
